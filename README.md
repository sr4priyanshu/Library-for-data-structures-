Linked List Implementation in C
📌 Overview
This project provides an implementation of a Singly Linked List in C with various operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and counting nodes. The code follows modular programming principles, with separate header (llist.h) and source (llist.c) files.

🚀 Features
Insertion at the left (beginning of the list)
Deletion from the left
Deletion of the first node
Displaying the linked list
Searching for an element
Counting the number of nodes
Reverse display using recursion
